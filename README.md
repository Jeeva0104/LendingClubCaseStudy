# Project Name
> This project focuses on analyzing the patterns of loan acceptance and rejection based on various factors such as loan amount, loan purpose, loan term, borrower grade, annual income, interest rates, and geographic location. The analysis explores how these factors influence whether a loan is accepted or rejected and provides insights into trends related to loan defaults, especially for "Charged Off" loans.



### Conclusion

This analysis reveals key factors that influence loan acceptance and rejection:

- **Loan Amount**: Loans between $5,000 and $15,000 are more likely to be approved, while loans over $30,000 are often rejected.
- **Loan Purpose**: Loans for personal reasons like cars and vacations tend to get approved, while small business loans face more rejections.
- **Loan Term**: Loans with a 36-month term are favored over 60-month loans.
- **Credit Grade**: Borrowers with higher grades (A and B) are more likely to get loans approved, while lower grades (E, F, G) face higher rejections.
- **Income**: Higher-income borrowers (over $100,000) have better chances of loan approval.
- **Interest Rates**: Loans with lower interest rates tend to be approved more.
- **Geographic Location**: Borrowers from New York tend to have a higher rate of loan charge-offs.
